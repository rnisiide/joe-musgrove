              <p><strong>This 10 day Classic Antarctica trip, also known as "The best of Antarctica", is our most common itinerary.</strong> First, here are some general information on activities that can happen during your trip:</p>
              <p><strong>Landings</strong> are a great opportunity to stretch your legs and visit the dense penguin colonies. During November you can expect to see penguins nesting on their eggs. While it's still a little early for penguin chick to have hatched, this is the time of year that we start to see the very first hatchings. Our expedition team will be on shore to help you spot any chicks, identify all the different species of penguins and seals as well as keep our guests safe on shore from any potential hazards.</p>
              <p><strong>Zodiac cruises</strong> are great for observing whales, icebergs, glaciers and penguins who may be out feeding at sea. Your driver will navigate around the area looking for wildlife and beautiful landscapes. By the end of the trip, Zodiac cruises tend to become the crowd favorite because of the vast diversity you get to experience on the cruises.</p>
              <p><strong>Ship Cruises:</strong> In the event we encounter bad weather and are able to disembark the ship, we will do what we call 'expedition day ships cruise". This is when we try to reposition the ship to a more protected location, while observing the wildlife and landscape around us. During this reposition, we encourage everyone to bundle up, head outside and enjoy this scenery. During this time, one of the expedition team specialists will likely offer a presentation related to Antarctica Wildlife, History, conservation or more!</p>

                <h5 class="h5 my-3"><strong>Nov 28th:</strong></h5>

                <p>Day 1 Embarkation in Ushuaia, Argentina and Beagle Channel: In the early afternoon you'll begin embarking the ship and familiarizing yourself with the vessel. You'll do some mandatory shipboard safety drills and get to know your expedition team and ship's crew. We'll begin to set sail in the early evening as we sail through the historic Beagle Channel. The Beagle is a great place to observe all types of wildlife, including potentially your first penguin sightings. Dolphin, whales and various bird species are frequently observed in the Beagle channel; so we suggest you bring your binoculars and spend as much time outside as possible during this transit. </p>
                
                <h5 class="h5 my-3"><strong>Nov 29th-30th:</strong></h5>
                
                <p>Sailing the Drake Passage heading to Antarctica</p>
                
                <p>When you wake up on the morning of the 29th, you'll be in the infamous Drake passage. You'll spend these next two days at sea attending some mandatory meetings regarding our operations while we are in Antarctica as well as be offered a variety of lectures and presentations from our expedition team guides. These presentations are a valuable educational resource to prepare you for  your experience when we arrive in Antarctica. You'll often find on our team a wide variety of science and historical backgrounds such as ornithologists, marine ecologists, marine biologists, environmental scientists, geologists, historians and many others. While seasickness is certainly a part of the experience in the Drake passage for some; every guest cabin on the Ocean Victory can live stream the lecture content on your cabin's TV incase you're not feeling well, you never need to miss a presentation. November is also a great time to observe whales as they migrate from the North down to Antarctica for the summer.. Various sea birds, including the Wandering Albatros can be seen during the transit. </p>
                
                <h5 class="h5 my-3"><strong>Dec 1st-Dec 4th:</strong></h5>
                            
                <p>Expedition days in Antarctica and S. Shetland Islands:</p>
                
                <p>Welcome to Antarctica! For the next four days, you'll be exploring Antarctica and it's surrounding islands. The goal for the next four days is to get everyone off the ship as much as possible. Our two main expedition activities are landing on shore and zodiac cruising. Weather dependent, we will try and do two activities per day for four days for eight total activities. There will be a morning activity after breakfast and an afternoon activity after lunch. During each activity, each group will have the opportunity to do both a landing and a zodiac cruise. We always try our hardest to meet this expectation, but because weather in Antarctica can be extremely unpredictable, we want everyone to be flexible and manage expectations. "Activities" include landings, zodiac cruises and ship's cruises. No matter what the activity for the day is, the expedition team will work as hard as they can in conjunction with the captain and the crew to maximize the guest experience. </p>
                
                <p><strong>A *typical* expedition day will look like this:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>0645: Wake up call</li>
                    <li>0700-0800: Breakfast</li>
                    <li>0830-1130: Morning activity - Landing and Zodiac Cruise</li>
                    <li>1230-1330: Lunch</li>
                    <li>1430-1730: Afternoon Activity - Landing and Zodiac Cruise</li>
                    <li>1830-1930: Evening Recap with Expedition team</li>
                    <li>1930: Dinner</li>
                    <li>2100: Evening entertainment or presentations with Expedition team.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>*** Subject to weather, scheduling and timing. ***</p>
           
                <h5 class="h5 my-3"><strong>Dec 5th - Dec 6th</strong></h5>
                
                <p>Departing Antarctica and reentering the Drake passage:</p>
                
                <p>Sadly, our time in Antarctica has come to an end, but the adventure isn't over. We will reenter the Drake passage as we head back towards Ushuaia. Hopefully we will still have plenty of wildlife sightings during the crossing, and the expedition team will continue to offer presentations. </p>
                
     
                <h5 class="h5 my-3"><strong>Dec 7tn</strong></h5>
                
                <p>Disembarkation in Ushuaia:</p>
                
                <p>The time has come to say goodbye to the Ocean Victory, your expedition team and crew, as well as all the new friends you made. However, it should never be goodbye....rather "see you later!".</p>
                
                Your luggage will be collected and taken off the ship for you, where courtesy busses will be provided to take you to the airport to catch your departing flight, or take you to the city center if you plan to stay in Ushuaia for a bit.

        <p>About the Ship: The unique X-bow was designed to pierce through the swell rather than ride over it, improving the ride in rough seas. The multiple disembarkation doors allow for quick, smooth and safe zodiac loading which means more time on land and exploring the Antarctica region. With 90% of the cabins offering balconies, and the ample outside view space; you're never far from observing the sites and wildlife of Antarctica. </p>

        <p>The Ocean Victory build was completed in 2021 and immediately headed South to begin it's exploring of Antarctica for the 21/22 season. I spent 114 days on board during the 21/22 season and can attest to it's comfort, speed, stability and well thought out design. It is the highest rated ice class hull currently in the fleet. It also holds the title of the most environmentally friendly ship operating in the polar regions. It carries a maximum of 188 passengers, with 88 crew.</p>
