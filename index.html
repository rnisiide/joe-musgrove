            <p><strong>We're so excited you will be joining us on this amazing Adventure.</strong> Not only will you get to explore the most remote place on Earth, but you'll be supporting a great cause as well.</p>

            <p>This trip does not include a charter flight option, which is by design. We feel that constrciting our guests to a set flight date, limits their freedom to travel at their own pace. There are parts of Argentina, Chile and Patagonia that are well worth visiting if you have the time. Even spending a few extra days in Ushuaia before or after you trip are days well spent. We are more than happy to help you book flights if you need assistance. However this guide should be a great starting point for you to understand how to get to Ushuaia, where to stay, and what you may enjoy doing while there. </p>

            <p>Below you'll find some important information about getting to Ushuaia, where our voyage will depart from; as well as information on where to stay and how to get around this small, remote, and welcoming city at the "End of the World". </p>

            <p>You will also find your trip itinerary, as well as a daily breakdown of the possible activities that will be included in the expedition!</p>

                  <p><strong>This 10 day Classic Antarctica trip, also known as "The best of Antarctica", is our most common itinerary.</strong> First, here are some general information on activities that can happen during your trip:</p>
                  <p><strong>Landings</strong> are a great opportunity to stretch your legs and visit the dense penguin colonies. During November you can expect to see penguins nesting on their eggs. While it's still a little early for penguin chick to have hatched, this is the time of year that we start to see the very first hatchings. Our expedition team will be on shore to help you spot any chicks, identify all the different species of penguins and seals as well as keep our guests safe on shore from any potential hazards.</p>
                  <p><strong>Zodiac cruises</strong> are great for observing whales, icebergs, glaciers and penguins who may be out feeding at sea. Your driver will navigate around the area looking for wildlife and beautiful landscapes. By the end of the trip, Zodiac cruises tend to become the crowd favorite because of the vast diversity you get to experience on the cruises.</p>
                  <p><strong>Ship Cruises:</strong> In the event we encounter bad weather and are able to disembark the ship, we will do what we call 'expedition day ships cruise". This is when we try to reposition the ship to a more protected location, while observing the wildlife and landscape around us. During this reposition, we encourage everyone to bundle up, head outside and enjoy this scenery. During this time, one of the expedition team specialists will likely offer a presentation related to Antarctica Wildlife, History, conservation or more!</p>

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                   
                    <h5 class="h5 my-2"><strong>Important details:</strong></h5>
                    <p>Buenos Aires International Airport Code: EZE - Ezeiza International Airport</p>
                    <p>Buenos Aires Domestic Airport Code: AEP - Aeroparque Jorge Newbery</p>
                    <p>Ushuaia Airport Code - USH </p>
                    <p>Latest arrival : Nov 27th, 2022</p>
                    <p>Earliest departure: Any departing flight Dec 7th, 2022 after 12pm</p>

                    <p>It's important you arrive in Ushuaia no later than Nov 27th, 2022. This allows a buffer time for lost luggage, missed connections or delayed flights. You can book your flight home out of USH anytime after 12pm on Dec 7th, 2022</p>

                    <p>All international flights will arrive in EZE, but flights to USH can leave from both EZE and AEP. However flights to USH are much more common departing from AEP.</p>

                    <p>EZE and AEP are around 45-75 minutes apart from each other, which is heavily dependent on traffic. There are a number of ways to get between airports which include private transfer offered in the airport, bus, taxi or Uber. We suggest Uber for it's safety and convenience, however if you're unable to book one, we suggest only hiring a taxi at the taxi stand inside the airport. The cost should be between $35 and $60 just depending which method you use and the exchange rate. I took an Uber March, 2022 and it was $4400ars which equates to about $44usd. </p>

                    <p>If you have to change airports in Buenos Aires, I suggest a MINIMUM of 4 hours between your arrival in EZE and your departure in AEP. This allows 2 hours to get you luggage and clear customs, an hour for the uber and to be at the airport an hour before departure from AEP. The same goes for the reverse when headed home and you need to transfer from AEP to EZE. Four hours is the minimum, however I would try and plan for 5 hours if possible. Another option, which most people do is spend a night or two in Buenos Aires.</p>


                    <h5 class="h5 my-2"><strong>Booking flights:</strong></h5>

                    <p>There are a few ways to go about this, and a few sites you can use. I personally always research my flights on Skyscanner and Google Flights, then if the price is about the same, I'll book my flight directly on the Airline of choice's website based on what I saw on the other sites. I have just found that when it comes to needing to make any changes, or have to deal with any issues that may come up with my flight, it's easier to work directly with the airline than to use a third party booking agency. </p>

                    <p>You can either book a roundtrip flight itinerary that goes from your home airport to USH and back. This is the safest way to do it because in the event you have a missed connection due to flight delays, you're covered for the cost of your connecting flight. This is my personal recommendation. However, if you're looking to save a little money, and have some time to spare...there is another option. I have found it cheaper, at times, to book a roundtrip international flight from my home city to EZE and back and then book a separate roundtrip flight from AEP/EZE to USH. This comes with risks and if choose this method, we're not responsible for any issues that come up. The main risk here is that if you don't leave yourself enough time between flights, and you have a cancelled flight or missed connection due to a delay, you will not be covered for the cost of your connecting flight because they are not on the same itinerary. I only...ONLY recommend this is you're planning a few days in Buenos Aires before and after your trip to allow for a buffer between flights. </p>

                    <p>Just a side note...if you get to pick your seats on the plane from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia, book a window seat on the starboard/right side of the plane. This will give you the best view of the mountains as you land in Ushuaia. </p>


                    <h5 class="h5 my-2"><strong>Getting from USH Airport to the City Center</strong></h5>

                    <p>Ushuaia is a very small city. The airport is a whopping 12 minute taxi to the city center and costs less than $10. Taxis are readily available out in front of the airport and there is a 97% chance the driver will know the location of whatever accommodation you booked unless it's an AirBnB tucked away in the suburbs. Once you get your luggage, you'll clear an agricultural checkpoint and you're out the door. It's about 40 steps from the luggage pickup to the front door of the airport. From there, you'll find plenty of taxis to take you in to town. Ushuaia is safe, and I've found every taxi driver to be honest. Just make sure they turn the meter on when you leave you airport. It's a good idea to half smaller cash denominations for taxi. </p>

                    <p>Here is a map giving an idea of the size and distances. The majority of all the hotels and things to do in the city are within the red box. </p>

                    <p>If you're traveling in a group, or would like us to arrange a private pickup and transfer from the airport, we can help arrange that. We have a transportation partner with a 12 passenger van.</p> 

                    <h5 class="h5 my-2"><strong>Where to stay in Ushuaia</strong></h5>

                    <p>As mentioned above, the vast majority of hotels in Ushuaia are within that red box. There are a few outliers, and some AirBnB's might slight be outside the center, but for the most part everything is centrally located and within walking distance to the shops and markets. I like to use Booking.com , HostelWorld, and AirBnB to find accommodation. There are options for everyone ranging from $50 a night up to $700 a night. It just depends on what you're looking for and how long to plan to spend in Ushuaia. </p>

                    <p>A few places I've stayed and can recommend are</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Alto Andino - My top recommendation. Affordable, clean, close to city center</li>
                        <li>Hotel Albatros - In front of the port, clean, comfortable. </li>
                        <li>Hostel Antarctica - Cheap, clean, hostel/backer vibes</li>
                        <li>Hotel Tierra Del Fuego - Central, affordable, clean</li>
                        <li>Magallena - Close to everything, Apartment style accommodation, affordable. </li>
                        <li>Arakur Hotel - Luxury hotel with heated infinity pools, pricey. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="h5 my-2"><strong>Getting to the ship:</strong></h5>
                    <p>When it comes to getting to the ship, further details will be communicated to you when we have a better understanding of the post-covid protocols. However the entrance to the pier where the ship is parked is right in the middle of the city center. If we're allowed to enter the pier ourselves, you will be given a luggage drop off location and will walk to the ship yourself. The luggage dropoff and ship are 3 minutes walking. If we're still required to use busses to enter the pier (like we had to in 21/22) you will drop your luggage off at the designated location and will meet a bus at a location right in front of the pier. The bus will be included in your price. </p>

                    <h5 class="h5 my-2"><strong>Things to do in Ushuaia:</strong></h5>
                    <p>Ushuaia has a wide variety things to do such as visiting the nation parks, trekking, 4x4 off-road adventures and plenty of other activities. A few months closer to the trip, we'll start offering optional activities to participate in. </p>

                    <p>Day 1 Embarkation in Ushuaia, Argentina and Beagle Channel: In the early afternoon you'll begin embarking the ship and familiarizing yourself with the vessel. You'll do some mandatory shipboard safety drills and get to know your expedition team and ship's crew. We'll begin to set sail in the early evening as we sail through the historic Beagle Channel. The Beagle is a great place to observe all types of wildlife, including potentially your first penguin sightings. Dolphin, whales and various bird species are frequently observed in the Beagle channel; so we suggest you bring your binoculars and spend as much time outside as possible during this transit. </p>

                    <p>Sailing the Drake Passage heading to Antarctica</p>
         
                    <p>When you wake up on the morning of the 29th, you'll be in the infamous Drake passage. You'll spend these next two days at sea attending some mandatory meetings regarding our operations while we are in Antarctica as well as be offered a variety of lectures and presentations from our expedition team guides. These presentations are a valuable educational resource to prepare you for  your experience when we arrive in Antarctica. You'll often find on our team a wide variety of science and historical backgrounds such as ornithologists, marine ecologists, marine biologists, environmental scientists, geologists, historians and many others. While seasickness is certainly a part of the experience in the Drake passage for some; every guest cabin on the Ocean Victory can live stream the lecture content on your cabin's TV incase you're not feeling well, you never need to miss a presentation. November is also a great time to observe whales as they migrate from the North down to Antarctica for the summer.. Various sea birds, including the Wandering Albatros can be seen during the transit. </p>

                    <p>Expedition days in Antarctica and S. Shetland Islands:</p>
         
                    <p>Welcome to Antarctica! For the next four days, you'll be exploring Antarctica and it's surrounding islands. The goal for the next four days is to get everyone off the ship as much as possible. Our two main expedition activities are landing on shore and zodiac cruising. Weather dependent, we will try and do two activities per day for four days for eight total activities. There will be a morning activity after breakfast and an afternoon activity after lunch. During each activity, each group will have the opportunity to do both a landing and a zodiac cruise. We always try our hardest to meet this expectation, but because weather in Antarctica can be extremely unpredictable, we want everyone to be flexible and manage expectations. "Activities" include landings, zodiac cruises and ship's cruises. No matter what the activity for the day is, the expedition team will work as hard as they can in conjunction with the captain and the crew to maximize the guest experience. </p>
         
                    <p><strong>A <em>typical</em> expedition day will look like this:</strong></p>

                    <p>Departing Antarctica and reentering the Drake passage:</p>
         
                    <p>Sadly, our time in Antarctica has come to an end, but the adventure isn't over. We will reenter the Drake passage as we head back towards Ushuaia. Hopefully we will still have plenty of wildlife sightings during the crossing, and the expedition team will continue to offer presentations. </p>

                    <p>Disembarkation in Ushuaia:</p>
         
                    <p>The time has come to say goodbye to the Ocean Victory, your expedition team and crew, as well as all the new friends you made. However, it should never be goodbye....rather "see you later!".</p>
         
                    Your luggage will be collected and taken off the ship for you, where courtesy busses will be provided to take you to the airport to catch your departing flight, or take you to the city center if you plan to stay in Ushuaia for a bit.

                <p>The unique X-bow was designed to pierce through the swell rather than ride over it, improving the ride in rough seas. The multiple disembarkation doors allow for quick, smooth and safe zodiac loading which means more time on land and exploring the Antarctica region. With 90% of the cabins offering balconies, and the ample outside view space; you're never far from observing the sites and wildlife of Antarctica. </p>
                <p>The Ocean Victory build was completed in 2021 and immediately headed South to begin it's exploring of Antarctica for the 21/22 season. I spent 114 days on board during the 21/22 season and can attest to it's comfort, speed, stability and well thought out design. It is the highest rated ice class hull currently in the fleet. It also holds the title of the most environmentally friendly ship operating in the polar regions. It carries a maximum of 188 passengers, with 88 crew.</p>
